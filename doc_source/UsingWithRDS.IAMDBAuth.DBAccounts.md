# Creating a database account using IAM authentication<a name="UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts"></a>

With IAM database authentication, you don't need to assign database passwords to the user accounts you create\. If you remove an IAM user that is mapped to a database account, you should also remove the database account with the `DROP USER` statement\.

**Note**  
The user name used for IAM authentication must match the case of the user name in the database\.

## Using IAM authentication with MySQL<a name="UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.MySQL"></a>

With MySQL, authentication is handled by `AWSAuthenticationPlugin`â€”an AWS\-provided plugin that works seamlessly with IAM to authenticate your IAM users\. Connect to the DB cluster and issue the `CREATE USER` statement, as shown in the following example\.

```
CREATE USER jane_doe IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS'; 
```

The `IDENTIFIED WITH` clause allows MySQL to use the `AWSAuthenticationPlugin` to authenticate the database account \(`jane_doe`\)\. The `AS 'RDS'` clause refers to the authentication method, and the specified database account should have the same name as the IAM user or role\. In this example, both the database account and the IAM user or role are named `jane_doe`\. 

**Note**  
If you see the following message, it means that the AWS\-provided plugin is not available for the current DB cluster\.  
`ERROR 1524 (HY000): Plugin 'AWSAuthenticationPlugin' is not loaded`  
To troubleshoot this error, verify that you are using a supported configuration and that you have enabled IAM database authentication on your DB cluster\. For more information, see [Availability for IAM database authentication](UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.md#UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Availability) and [Enabling and disabling IAM database authentication](UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Enabling.md)\.

After you create an account using `AWSAuthenticationPlugin`, you manage it in the same way as other database accounts\. For example, you can modify account privileges with `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements, or modify various account attributes with the `ALTER USER` statement\. 

## Using IAM authentication with PostgreSQL<a name="UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.PostgreSQL"></a>

To use IAM authentication with PostgreSQL, connect to the DB cluster, create database users, and then grant them the `rds_iam` role as shown in the following example\.

```
CREATE USER db_userx; 
GRANT rds_iam TO db_userx;
```

The specified database account should have the same name as the IAM user or role\. In this example, both the database account and the IAM user or role are named `db_userx`\. 

Note that a PostgreSQL database user can use either IAM or Kerberos authentication but not both, so this user can't also have the `rds_ad` role\. This also applies to nested memberships\. For more information, see [ Step 7: Create Kerberos authentication PostgreSQL logins ](postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.md#postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.create-logins)\.
