## Using Aurora Replicas<a name="AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Replicas"></a>

An *Aurora Replica* is an independent endpoint in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability\. An Aurora DB cluster can include up to 15 Aurora Replicas located throughout the Availability Zones of the Aurora DB cluster's AWS Region\.

The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster\. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary writer DB instance and to Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster\. For more information about Aurora Replicas, see [Aurora Replicas](Aurora.Replication.md#Aurora.Replication.Replicas)\.

Aurora Replicas work well for read scaling because they're fully dedicated to read operations on your cluster volume\. The writer DB instance manages write operations\. The cluster volume is shared among all instances in your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster\. Thus, no extra work is needed to replicate a copy of the data for each Aurora Replica\.

Aurora PostgreSQLâ€“based DB clusters don't support Aurora Replicas in different AWS Regions\. That means you can't configure your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster for cross\-region replication\. However, you can scale reads and achieve high availability for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster by using the Aurora global database feature\. Aurora global databases have a single read/write primary DB cluster in one AWS Region and up to five read\-only secondary DB clusters in different Regions\. For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora global databases](aurora-global-database.md)\. 

In addition to supporting Aurora Replicas, PostgreSQL has its own native replication capabilities, such as *logical replication*\. Unlike an Aurora Replica, PostgreSQL read replicas use a single thread to apply all write operations from the primary DB instance to their local data store\. This limitation can affect the ability of PostgreSQL read replicas to support large volumes of write traffic\.

**Note**  
Rebooting the writer DB instance of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster also automatically reboots the Aurora Replicas for that DB cluster\. The automatic reboot re\-establishes an entry point that guarantees read/write consistency across the DB cluster\.

## Monitoring Aurora PostgreSQL replication<a name="AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Monitoring"></a>

Read scaling and high availability depend on minimal lag time\. You can monitor how far an Aurora Replica is lagging behind the writer DB instance of your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster by monitoring the Amazon CloudWatch `ReplicaLag` metric\. Because Aurora Replicas read from the same cluster volume as the writer DB instance, the `ReplicaLag` metric has a different meaning for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster\. The `ReplicaLag` metric for an Aurora Replica indicates the lag for the page cache of the Aurora Replica compared to that of the writer DB instance\.
