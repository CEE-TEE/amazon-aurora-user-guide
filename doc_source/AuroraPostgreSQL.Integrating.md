# Integrating Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with other AWS services<a name="AuroraPostgreSQL.Integrating"></a>

Amazon Aurora integrates with other AWS services so that you can extend your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to use additional capabilities in the AWS Cloud\. Your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster can use AWS services to do the following:
+ Quickly collect, view, and assess performance for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB instances with Amazon RDS Performance Insights\. Performance Insights expands on existing Amazon RDS monitoring features to illustrate your database's performance and help you analyze any issues that affect it\. With the Performance Insights dashboard, you can visualize the database load and filter the load by waits, SQL statements, hosts, or users\. For more information about Performance Insights, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](USER_PerfInsights.md)\. 
+ Configure your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to publish log data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. CloudWatch Logs provide highly durable storage for your log records\. With CloudWatch Logs, you can perform real\-time analysis of the log data, and use CloudWatch to create alarms and view metrics\. For more information, see [Publishing Aurora PostgreSQL logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](AuroraPostgreSQL.CloudWatch.md)\.
+ Import data from an Amazon S3 bucket to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, or export data from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to an Amazon S3 bucket\. For more information, see [Importing data from Amazon S3 into an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](USER_PostgreSQL.S3Import.md) and [Exporting data from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to Amazon S3](postgresql-s3-export.md)\.
+ Add machine learning\-based predictions to database applications using the SQL language\. Aurora machine learning uses a highly optimized integration between the Aurora database and the AWS machine learning \(ML\) services SageMaker and Amazon Comprehend\. For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora machine learning with Aurora PostgreSQL](postgresql-ml.md)\.
+ Invoke AWS Lambda functions from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster\. To do this, use the `aws_lambda` PostgreSQL extension provided with Aurora PostgreSQL\. For more information, see [Invoking an AWS Lambda function from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](PostgreSQL-Lambda.md)\.
+ Integrate queries from Amazon Redshift and Aurora PostgreSQL\. For more information, see [ Getting started with using federated queries to PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/getting-started-federated.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\.
