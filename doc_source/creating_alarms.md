# Creating CloudWatch alarms to monitor Amazon Aurora<a name="creating_alarms"></a>

You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state\. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period that you specify\. The alarm can also perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods\. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy\.

Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only\. CloudWatch alarms don't invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state\. The state must have changed and have been maintained for a specified number of time periods\. The following procedures show how to create alarms for Amazon RDS\.

**Note**  
For Aurora, use `WRITER` or `READER` role metrics to set up alarms instead of relying on metrics for specific DB instances\. Aurora DB instance roles can change roles over time\. You can find these role\-based metrics in the CloudWatch console\.  
Aurora Auto Scaling automatically sets alarms based on `READER` role metrics\. For more information about Aurora Auto Scaling, see [Using Amazon Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora replicas](Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.md)\. 

**To set alarms using the CloudWatch console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose **Alarms** and then choose **Create Alarm**\. Doing this launches the Create Alarm Wizard\. 

1. Choose **RDS Metrics** and scroll through the Amazon RDS metrics to find the metric that you want to place an alarm on\. To display just Amazon RDS metrics, search for the identifier of your resource\. Choose the metric to create an alarm on and then choose **Next**\.

1. Enter **Name**, **Description**, and **Whenever** values for the metric\. 

1. If you want CloudWatch to send you an email when the alarm state is reached, for **Whenever this alarm**, choose **State is ALARM**\. For **Send notification to**, choose an existing SNS topic\. If you choose **Create topic**, you can set the name and email addresses for a new email subscription list\. This list is saved and appears in the field for future alarms\. 
**Note**  
If you use **Create topic** to create a new Amazon SNS topic, the email addresses must be verified before they receive notifications\. Emails are only sent when the alarm enters an alarm state\. If this alarm state change happens before the email addresses are verified, the addresses don't receive a notification\.

1. Preview the alarm that you're about to create in the **Alarm Preview** area, and then choose **Create Alarm**\.
