# Working with Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL<a name="Aurora.AuroraPostgreSQL"></a><a name="pgsql"></a>

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is a fully managed, PostgreSQL\-compatible, and ACID\-compliant relational database engine that combines the speed and reliability of high\-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost\-effectiveness of open\-source databases\. Aurora PostgreSQL is a drop\-in replacement for PostgreSQL and makes it simple and cost\-effective to set up, operate, and scale your new and existing PostgreSQL deployments, thus freeing you to focus on your business and applications\. Amazon RDS provides administration for Aurora by handling routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair\. Amazon RDS also provides push\-button migration tools to convert your existing Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL applications to Aurora PostgreSQL\.

Aurora PostgreSQL can work with many industry standards\. For example, you can use Aurora PostgreSQL databases to build HIPAA\-compliant applications and to store healthcare related information, including protected health information \(PHI\), under a completed Business Associate Agreement \(BAA\) with AWS\.

Aurora PostgreSQL is FedRAMP HIGH eligible\. For details about AWS and compliance efforts, see [AWS services in scope by compliance program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\.
