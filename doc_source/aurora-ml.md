# Using machine learning capabilities with Amazon Aurora<a name="aurora-ml"></a>

Following, you can learn how to use AWS machine learning services with your Aurora database applications\. By using Amazon Aurora machine learning, you can integrate your Aurora DB cluster with Amazon Comprehend or Amazon SageMaker or both, depending on your needs\. Amazon Comprehend and Amazon SageMaker each support specific machine learning use cases, as follows\.
+ **Amazon Comprehend** – Amazon Comprehend is a managed natural language processing \(NLP\) service that's used to extract insights from documents\. With Amazon Comprehend, you can deduce sentiment based on the content of documents, by analyzing entities, key phrases, language, and other features\. To learn more, see [What is Amazon Comprehend?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.html) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*\. For a list of AWS Regions where Amazon Comprehend is available, see [Amazon Comprehend endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/comprehend.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. 
+ **Amazon SageMaker** – Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service\. Data scientists and developers use Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and test machine learning models for a variety of inference tasks, such as fraud detection and product recommendation\. When a machine learning model is ready for use in production, it can be deployed to the Amazon SageMaker hosted environment\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon SageMaker?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide*\. For a list of AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker is available, see [Amazon SageMaker endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. 

To integrate Aurora machine learning with your Aurora DB cluster, the Amazon Comprehend and the Amazon SageMaker components must be set up and ready for use\. The data scientists on your team work with SageMaker to get the models ready for use\. The database developers on your team can focus on using the Amazon Comprehend or the SageMaker services through the familiar SQL database interface after Aurora machine learning is integrated with your Aurora DB cluster\. For more information about Amazon Aurora machine learning, see [Amazon Aurora ML](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/machine-learning/)\.

Aurora machine learning is supported in certain AWS Regions and for specific versions of Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL only\. Before trying to set up Aurora machine learning, check availability in your AWS Region for your Aurora MySQL or Aurora PostgreSQL version\. For details, see [Aurora machine learning](Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.Aurora_ML.md)\.
